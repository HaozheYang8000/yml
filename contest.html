        <h1>The Yang Math League Round 30</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>A large urn contains $100$ balls, of which $36 \%$ are red and the rest are blue. How many of the blue balls must be removed so that the percentage of red balls in the urn will be $72 \%$? (No red balls are to be removed.) <br/> $\textbf{(A)}\ 28 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\  32 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\  36 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\   50 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 64$</li>
            <li>While exploring a cave, Carl comes across a collection of $5$-pound rocks worth $\$14$ each, $4$-pound rocks worth $\$11$ each, and $1$-pound rocks worth $\$2$ each. There are at least $20$ of each size. He can carry at most $18$ pounds. What is the maximum value, in dollars, of the rocks he can carry out of the cave? <br/> $\textbf{(A) } 48 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 49 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 50 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 51 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 52$</li>
            <li>How many ways can a student schedule $3$ mathematics courses -- algebra, geometry, and number theory -- in a $6$-period day if no two mathematics courses can be taken in consecutive periods? (What courses the student takes during the other $3$ periods is of no concern here.) <br/> $\textbf{(A) }3\qquad\textbf{(B) }6\qquad\textbf{(C) }12\qquad\textbf{(D) }18\qquad\textbf{(E) }24$</li>
            <li>Alice, Bob, and Charlie were on a hike and were wondering how far away the nearest town was. When Alice said, "We are at least $6$ miles away," Bob replied, "We are at most $5$ miles away." Charlie then remarked, "Actually the nearest town is at most $4$ miles away." It turned out that none of the three statements were true. Let $d$ be the distance in miles to the nearest town. Which of the following intervals is the set of all possible values of $d$? <br/> $\textbf{(A) }   (0,4)   \qquad        \textbf{(B) }   (4,5)   \qquad    \textbf{(C) }   (4,6)   \qquad   \textbf{(D) }  (5,6)  \qquad  \textbf{(E) }   (5,\infty)$</li>
            <li>What is the sum of all possible values of $k$ for which the polynomials $x^2 - 3x + 2$ and $x^2 - 5x + k$ have a root in common? <br/> $\textbf{(A) } 3\qquad\textbf{(B) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 5\qquad\textbf{(D) } 6 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 10$</li>
            <li>For positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m+10  n+1$, both the mean and the median of the set $\{m, m+4, m+10, n+1, n+2, 2n\}$ are equal to $n$. What is $m+n$? <br/> $\textbf{(A) }20\qquad\textbf{(B) }21\qquad\textbf{(C) }22\qquad\textbf{(D) }23\qquad\textbf{(E) }24$</li>
